  My name is Brett Reimers. By profession an aquatic ecologist, in my own time a
  nature photographer based in Durban. I have been blessed to have travelled
  fairly widely in my work and private time. I enjoy capturing stills of moments
  in time. This I do for fun and to fund my camera equipment fund which is ever
  hungry. I shoot most of pics on my trusty Canon 70D (which I adore). I really
  hope you like my artwork, and I look forward to speaking with you.
